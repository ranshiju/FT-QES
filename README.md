# FT-QES
* Codes for calculating the physical-bath Hamiltonians of 1D and 2D (homeycomb) models  
* Ref: "Quantum simulation for thermodynamics of infinite-size many-body systems by O(10) sites" ([arXiv:1810.01612](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01612))  

## For 1D chain, see 'QES_1D_bath_H'
Step 1. prepare Parameter.m. One may edit the physical and computational parameters as your wish  
Step 2. Run 'MainBH.m'  
Step 3. Load the mat file in the current folder; the physical-bath Hamiltonians are saved in as a cell.

## For 2D honeycom lattice, see 'QES_honeycomb_bath_H'
Step 1. prepare Parameter.m. One may edit the physical and computational parameters as your wish (first 22 rows)  
Step 2. Run 'MainBH.m'  
Step 3. Load the mat file in the current folder; the physical-bath Hamiltonians are saved in as a cell.
